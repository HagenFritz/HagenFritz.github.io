Hi, I'm Hagen. 

![Hagen](/photos/A799776E-B47A-4FA2-957B-603DC9F86241_1_201_a.jpeg)

I am a PhD candidate in the Building Energy and Environments concentration within the Civil, Architectural, and Environmental Engineering department at The University of Texas at Austin. My research centers around the development and application of consumer-grade sensors to monitor indoor air quality and relating these data to outcomes of human health measured through similar means. The work I do is supported by Whole Communities, Whole â€“ a UT Grand Challenge and I am advised by Drs. [Kerry Kinney](https://www.caee.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/kinney) and [Zoltan Nagy](https://www.caee.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/nagy). You can find out more about the work we do in the Intelligent Enviornments Lab by visiting Dr. Nagy's [website](https://nagy.caee.utexas.edu).

I was born and raised in the DFW area in Texas, moved down to Austin for school, and have been here ever since. I live in northwest Austin with my fiance and cat and enjoy being outdoors, relaxing with video games, and playing volleyball (beach primarily). I am currently in what should be my last semester of school finishing up my PhD. I look forward to taking the skills I learned during my time in school to explore opportunities in data science that connect to issues related to the built environment and/or climate change.
