Hi, I'm Hagen.

![Hagen](/photos/hookem.jpeg)

I was born and raised in the DFW area in Texas, moved down to Austin for school, and been here ever since. I live in northwest Austin with my fiance and cat (who we simply refer to as "Nugget") and enjoy being outdoors, relaxing with video games, and playing volleyball (beach primarily). I am currently _still_ in school finishing up my PhD, but looking to take the skills I learned during my time in school to explore opportunities in data science that connect to issues relating climate change.
